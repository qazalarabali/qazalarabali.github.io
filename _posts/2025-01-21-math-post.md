Mathematics is beautiful! Here's an example of an inline math expression: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$.

For display mode, the equation is shown below:

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} \, dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

We can also label equations for reference:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:example}
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
\end{equation}

And refer to it like this: Equation \eqref{eq:example}.
