## About Me

Hello! My name is Qazal Arabali, and I’m a final-year Computer Engineering student at **Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)**. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a deep passion for **Artificial Intelligence**, **Software Engineering**, and **Deep Learning**, which I find incredibly fascinating and rewarding to explore.

Beyond academics, I am also a musician at heart. I play the **piano** and **cajón**, a passion I’ve been pursuing since I was 14 years old. Music is not just a hobby for me; it’s a way to express myself and find harmony in life.

In addition to music, I actively participate in **CrossFit** as my sport of choice. It keeps me energized, disciplined, and motivated to stay healthy and active.

Another one of my cherished hobbies is **writing**. I love putting my thoughts into words and crafting stories, essays, or reflections that connect with people and inspire creativity.

Feel free to connect with me through the social links below or learn more about my journey on this site!
