### Overview

This project implemented a smart home automation system that allows users to control and monitor home appliances remotely. The system combines IoT devices with a mobile app to provide a seamless user experience.

### Features

- **Remote Control :** Operate home appliances such as lights, fans, and air conditioners via a mobile app.
- **Energy Monitoring :** View real-time data on energy consumption for better efficiency.
- **Automation Rules :** Set rules like turning on lights at a specific time or when entering a room.
- **Voice Command Support :** Integrated with Google Assistant for hands-free control.

### Technologies Used

- **Arduino Microcontroller :** To interface with IoT sensors and actuators.
- **MQTT Protocol :** Ensures secure and lightweight communication between devices.
- **Android Studio :** For building the mobile app.
- **Node-RED :** Used to create workflows for automation.

### Architecture

The system comprises three main layers:

1. **IoT Devices :** Sensors and actuators connected to an Arduino board.
2. **Communication Layer :** Uses the MQTT protocol to transmit data between devices.
3. **Mobile Application :** Provides a user-friendly interface for control and monitoring.

### Results

- Improved energy efficiency by 30% through automation.
- Enhanced user convenience with remote and voice-controlled operations.

### Future Plans

- Add compatibility with Alexa and Siri.
- Expand the system to include security features like motion detection and CCTV monitoring.
